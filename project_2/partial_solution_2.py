# TODO: Step 1 - Load JSON Lines File
# HINT: Use the 'open' function to read the file. Don't forget the 'with' statement for proper file handling.

documents = []  # Placeholder for the documents to be loaded

# TODO: Step 2 - Read Each Line from File and Parse JSON
# HINT: Inside the 'with' statement, use a loop to read each line, parse it as JSON, and append to 'documents'.

# TODO: Step 3 - Retrieve API Key
# HINT: Use 'os.getenv' to retrieve the 'OPENAI_API_KEY' environment variable. Make sure it's been set in your environment.

api_key = None  # Placeholder for the API key

# TODO: Step 4 - Initialize OpenAI Embeddings
# HINT: Create an instance of 'OpenAIEmbeddings' with your 'model_name' and 'api_key'.

model_name = 'text-embedding-ada-002'  # Provided model name
embeddings = None  # Placeholder for the embeddings object

# TODO: Step 5 - Set Up Chroma Vector Store
# HINT: Initialize 'Chroma' with the necessary parameters. Consider what each parameter means and pass them appropriately.

vectorstore = None  # Placeholder for the Chroma vector store instance

# TODO: Step 6 - Add Documents to Vector Store
# HINT: Iterate through 'documents'. Convert each one to a string and add to your 'vectorstore' using 'add_texts'. 
# Consider using 'tqdm' for a progress bar.

# TODO: Step 7 - Create a Query for Similarity Search
# HINT: Define a string variable 'query' with an appropriate text question for retrieval.

query = ""  # Placeholder for the query

# TODO: Step 8 - Execute Similarity Search
# HINT: Use the 'similarity_search' method of your 'vectorstore' with your 'query'. Analyze what this function returns.

docs = None  # Placeholder for the search results

# TODO: Step 9 - Display Top Result
# HINT: Access the first element of 'docs' and print it. Check if 'docs' is not empty before doing so.

# After following all the steps and replacing placeholders with actual code, 
# you should have a working script that reads documents, processes them through an embeddings model, 
# and performs a similarity search. Don't forget to handle potential errors and edge cases, 
# such as what happens if the API key is missing or if 'docs' is empty.
