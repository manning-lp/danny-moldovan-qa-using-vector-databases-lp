# TODO: Step 1 - Create a retriever from the vector store we defined in the last milestone.
# The retriever will help in fetching relevant documents or embeddings.
retriever = None  # TODO: Replace 'None' with the method to create a retriever from 'vectorstore'.

# TODO: Step 2 - Initialize the Retrieval-based Question Answering system.
# You will need to use the 'RetrievalQA' and 'ChatOpenAI' classes for this purpose.
qa = None  # TODO: Create an instance of 'RetrievalQA' using appropriate parameters.

# Hints: 
# - 'llm' parameter needs an instance of a language model for processing queries, which is 'ChatOpenAI()' in this case.
# - 'chain_type' defines the type of processing chain. It should be "map_reduce" for this setup.
# - 'retriever' is the instance you created in Step 1, responsible for fetching data.

# TODO: Step 3 - Run the QA system with a query.
# The system will fetch and process information to return a response.
response = None  # TODO: Execute the 'run' method of your 'qa' instance with a string query.

# Hint: 
# - The query is a string. Example: "what is the retrieval qa chain?"

# TODO: Step 4 - Handle the response.
# You should implement a way to properly output or use the response returned by the QA system.
# TODO: Replace the 'pass' with your code to handle 'response' appropriately.
# This could be simply printing or maybe more complex logic based on your application's needs.

# After you complete the TODOs, you should have a working retrieval-based QA system.
